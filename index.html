      <p>So about me:<br>
        Currently I´m 29 years old and living in Estonia.<br>
        I speak Estonian, English and bit Russian.<br>
        <br>
        Now about my journey of coding:<br>
        I started coding at beginning of february 2021. I'm doing my best to learn HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and others.
        And hope I will find job one day as a full-stack developer or at first a front-end developer. I first started
        working with JavaScript and took Udemy course from Jonas Schmedtmann. Course is named: "The
        Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert". I have final project to do and then I have worked through
        this course. But I still need loads of practice and I think I will go through once again this course when I
        finish reading David Flanagan's JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. More about what courses I'm currently taking
        you will find from
        <span><a id="learn" href="#section3">my education.</a></span> Before I started learning coding I worked for
        Estonian
        Environmental Inspectorate for 6 years and 3 months. My main job tasks were control fishing in Lake Peipus. It
        was interesting time, but all things will come to end someday.<br>
        <br>
        Now my future visions: <br>
        <br>
        First I want to get more knowledge in JavaScript and practice coding generally.<br>
        Then I want to try and make webpages in different styles and maybe using more JavaScript and doing some complex
        concepts.<br>
        Finally I want to make efficient codes and be a good senior full-stack developer.<br>
        <br>
        And most important: NEVER GIVE UP!

      <p>In here I will but my current projects what I have done in Udemy course mainly. These current projects are from
        Jonas JavaScript course. I changed some codes to estonian for fun and I hope it came out great.
      NB! Websites are not responsive, beacause main focus is on JavaScript! Best to watch on pc. </p>
